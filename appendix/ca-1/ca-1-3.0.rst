Chapter 3: Random Numbers, Samples, and Maps
============================================

3.1 Random Number Tables
------------------------

A random number table is a list of single digits (0-9) that occur in a totally uncoordinated and random order. These tables have two basic properties:

1. Each digit occurs with the same overall frequency.
2. There is no correlation between the occurrence of one digit and its neighbors.

From these properties, we can combine digits to form random numbers of any length or size.

**Using Random Number Tables**

To use random number tables, first select a starting point (e.g., page 3, row 4, column 2). Then decide if you will read numbers down a column or across a row. Write down the numbers as they appear, following these rules mechanically.

Examples:

- **Selecting 10 random numbers between 00 and 99**: Choose a starting point, then write down the first ten two-digit numbers in the order they appear.
- **Selecting random numbers within a specific range** (e.g., 35 to 73): Write down numbers within the range and discard any outside it.
- **Selecting three-digit numbers**: Group the digits in sets of three, either by reading down columns or across rows. Larger numbers can be created similarly.

3.2 Simple Random Samples
-------------------------

Most sampling is conducted using a simple random sample without replacement, which meets the following requirements:

1. Each sample unit in the population has an equal chance of being chosen.
2. All possible combinations of sample units of a given size are equally likely.
3. A sample unit may only appear once in a sample.

This type of sample is referred to as *equal probability sampling without replacement*. It is performed by first numbering each sample unit, then using random numbers to select units. If a number repeats, it is simply discarded.

3.3 Choosing Random Points along a Line
---------------------------------------

To locate points randomly along a line (e.g., a transect line of 6 km on a map), divide the line into units (e.g., 60 units of 100 meters each). Each unit is then assigned a number (00 to 60). Select random points along the line by choosing numbers in this range. If a number repeats or falls outside the range, discard it. Define one end of the line as point 00 and locate each point accordingly (e.g., number 13 represents a point 1300 meters from 00).

3.4 Choosing Random Points in Space
-----------------------------------

To locate random points within an area, follow these steps:

1. Set up x and y axes on the map covering the entire area.
2. Divide each axis into convenient intervals (e.g., 100 meters).
3. Use random number tables to select pairs of numbers where each pair represents a coordinate along the x and y axes.

Points are plotted by locating them along the two axes. If a point falls outside the boundary of the area, discard it. Continue drawing pairs until the required number of points is located within the area.

3.5 Maps
--------

Maps are essential for census work, and it’s important to understand map scales, particularly for locating sample units and measuring areas.

**Understanding Map Scales**

The scale of a map represents the relationship between a distance on the map and the corresponding distance on the ground. For example, a 1:250,000 scale means that one unit on the map represents 250,000 units on the ground. Misinterpreting a scale can lead to significant errors in sample estimates.

**Measuring Area on Maps**

To measure an area accurately:

1. **Planimeter**: Use a planimeter, an instrument that measures area directly by tracing the outline of a region on the map. First, calibrate the planimeter by measuring a known area, then use this calibration for other measurements.

2. **Alternative Methods**:
   - **Cut-and-Weigh Method**: Trace the census zone onto paper along with a square of known area. Cut both out and weigh them. Use the ratio of weights to calculate the area.
   - **Dot Grid Method**: Place a transparent grid with regularly spaced dots over the map. Count the dots within a known area, then count the dots within the census zone. Use the ratio to estimate the area.

**Example of Planimeter Use**

To calculate an area on a 1:250,000 map:

- Draw a 2 cm square on the map representing 25 km².
- Measure this square multiple times with the planimeter to get an average reading (A).
- Measure the census zone similarly, obtaining an average reading (a').
- Calculate the area using the formula:
Area = (A / a') * known area in km²
Repeat this process multiple times for accuracy, then average the results.
